I think keeping a TODO will allow me to have concrete, measurable goals to accomplish.

O/S Features to be accomplished

Majors 
| Feature Name | Description | Notes |
|--------------|-------------|-------|
|Memory Management| Paging, Virtual Memory and what not.|   Not super important.|
|File System   | File System as known to mankind.|Need to implement/support at least 1 file system. This is quite important becuase the FS gives the O/S a way to store/load/unload the binaries that I want to to run as processes.|
|Processes     | Short term I want to be able to run simple x86 32-bit binaries.| E.g. a simple hello_word.asm|

Minors
| Feature Name | Description | Notes |
|--------------|-------------|-------|
|Increase disk load capacity| Currently, if the bootsector attempts to load up to 50 sectors, problems arise. | Fix this. |
